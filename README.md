This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# Frontend TODO App with JSONPlaceholder API

This is a frontend TODO app that utilizes the JSONPlaceholder API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on posts. It allows users to view a list of posts, create new posts, view individual posts by ID, and filter posts based on specific criteria ( limit and id of posts ).

## Features

- View a list of posts
- Create new posts
- View individual posts by ID
- Filter posts based on specific criteria (e.g., limit, user ID)

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- JSONPlaceholder API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandeep7567/MockMagic.git


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
